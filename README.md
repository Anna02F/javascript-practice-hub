# JavaScript Practice Hub

Welcome to the **JS Practice Hub**, where I explore different JavaScript techniques and performance optimizations.

## Debounce vs Throttle

The **debounce and throttle** project explores how these two essential techniques can help optimize performance, particularly in scenarios where events (like typing, scrolling, or resizing) fire frequently.

- **Debounce**: Waits until the user stops triggering an event for a specified time before running the function.
- **Throttle**: Ensures the function runs at most once within a specified time interval, even if the event keeps firing.

This practice is all about learning how to improve performance and keep things smooth in your UI. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the timing, and see how it works in action!
